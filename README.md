# copilot-demo-py

# This is a demo of the GitHub Copilot code completion tool. It is a simple Python script that uses the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to make a request to the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to get information about the [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) repository.
